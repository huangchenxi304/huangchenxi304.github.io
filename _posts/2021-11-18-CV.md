### RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS

**Jianzhe Zhao, Xingwei Wang\*, Keming Mao, <u>Chenxi Huang</u>, Yukai Su and Yuchen Li,<br>*[Correlated Differential Privacy of Multiparty Data Release in Machine Learning](https://jcst.ict.ac.cn/EN/10.1007/s11390-021-1754-5)*,** accepted to ***Journal of Computer Science and Technology*** (CCF: B, IF: 1.571), 2021

- In this paper, we proposed a novel correlated differential privacy of the multiparty data release (MP-CRDP), which effectively reduces the merged dataset’s dimensionality and correlated sensitivity in two steps to optimize the utility
- We also proposed a multiparty correlation analysis technique by designing a more reasonable standard to measure the correlated degree, reducing correlated sensitivity and thus improve the data utility
- By adding noise to the weights of machine learning algorithms and query noise to the release data, MP-CRDP provides the release technology for both low-noise private data and private machine learning algorithms
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method on the utilized Adult and Breast Cancer datasets

**Jianzhe Zhao, Keming Mao, <u>Chenxi Huang</u> and Yuyang Zeng,<br>*[Utility Optimization of Federated Learning with Differential Privacy](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ddns/2021/3344862/)*,** ***Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society*** (IF: 1.348), 2021

- Proposed a novel differentially private federated learning framework to address the trade-off problems between privacy and utility in complex federated learning
- Analyzed the impact of data heterogeneity of participants on global model accuracy quantitatively based on 1-Wasserstein distance
- Then designed a multi-level and multi-participant dynamic allocation method of privacy budget to reduce the injected noise, and the utility can be improved efficiently
- Finally designed a novel adaptive differentially private federated learning algorithm (A-DPFL)
- Conducted comprehensive experiments on redefined non-I.I.D MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of model accuracy, convergence, and robustness
